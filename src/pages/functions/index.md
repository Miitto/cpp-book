# Functions

A function is a block of code that can be executed programmatically. Functions are used to group code together, and to make code more readable and maintainable. Functions can be called from other functions, and can be reused multiple times throughout a program. Functions are usually created to perform a specific task, for example calculating the area of a circle. Functions can take parameters, which can be given to the function when it is called - this can be thought of as input to the function. Functions can also return a value, which can be thought of as output from the function.

In this chapter we will learn how to create and use functions in C++.
