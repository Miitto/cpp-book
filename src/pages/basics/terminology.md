# Terminology

## Expression

An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that are evaluated to produce a result. For example, `x + 5` is an expression that adds the value of `x` to `5`.

## Statement

A statement is a complete instruction that performs some action. In C++, statements are terminated by a semicolon `;`. For example, `x = 5;` is a statement that assigns the value `5` to the variable `x`.
The difference between an expression and a statement is that an expression evaluates to a value, and a statement does something.

## Condition

A condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value (`true` or `false`). Conditions are used in control flow statements such as `if`, `else`, `while`, and `for` to determine which block of code to execute.  
Note that both `true` and `false` themselves can be used as conditions.
